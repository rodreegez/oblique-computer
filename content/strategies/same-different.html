<h1>Make things that are the same, the same. Make things that are different, different.</h1>

<p>
    Identify what something is, and then make it be that. Make everything that
    is like that thing be that, too. If something is different, consider whay
    that might be. If it really is different, make it be a different thing.

<p>
    There are no "sort-ofs". Something is either one of these, or one of
    those. Decide and commit.
